WidebandO2One
==
First Wideband O2 Controller for Bosch LS 4.9 Sensors
Key Elements
--
* Uses ATTiny 1626 micorprocessor as the micro as they are cheap and easy to program. It is using the Arduino code base.
* Wideband O2 blog [here](https://alshowto.com/wideband-o2-one/) for more details. 
* Uses the Bosch CJ125 controller chip as the basis of sensor control.
* More to come as project expands into my [99 Ford F150](https://alshowto.com/category/electronics/99-f150-rebuild/) project.

So far, I only have the schematics done. Code to follow shortly, but loosly based on Arduino shield code from [here](http://www.bylund-automotive.com/educative/lambda/).

Works Only With LS 4.9 sensors
--
 * However, with some rework it will work with 4.2 Sensors, but I am not sure why one would use 4.2
